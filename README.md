# ðŸ§± Vanilla Blockchain in JavaScript

This project is a **from-scratch implementation of a basic blockchain** using only vanilla JavaScript. It's designed to help you understand the core components of how blockchains like Ethereum work â€” including blocks, hashing, mining, and validation â€” without relying on external frameworks.
